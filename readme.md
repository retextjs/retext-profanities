[**retext**][retext] plugin to check for [profane and vulgar][profanities]
wording.
Uses [`cuss`][cuss] for sureness.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-profanities
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.txt`:

```txt
He’s pretty set on beating your butt for sheriff.
```

…and our script, `example.js`, looks like this:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var english = require('retext-english')
var stringify = require('retext-stringify')
var profanities = require('retext-profanities')

unified()
  .use(english)
  .use(profanities)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.txt'), function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```txt
example.txt
  1:33-1:37  warning  Be careful with “butt”, it’s profane in some cases  butt  retext-profanities

⚠ 1 warning
```
