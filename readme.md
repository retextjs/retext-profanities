# retext-profanities [![Build][build-badge]][build] [![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage] [![Downloads][downloads-badge]][downloads] [![Chat][chat-badge]][chat]

Check for [profane and vulgar][profanities] wording with
[**retext**][retext].  Uses [cuss][] for sureness.

## Installation

[npm][]:

```bash
npm install retext-profanities
```

## Usage

Say we have the following file, `example.txt`:

```text
He’s pretty set on beating your butt for sheriff.
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks like this:

```javascript
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')
var unified = require('unified')
var english = require('retext-english')
var stringify = require('retext-stringify')
var profanities = require('retext-profanities')

unified()
  .use(english)
  .use(profanities)
  .use(stringify)
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.txt'), function(err, file) {
    console.error(report(err || file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```text
example.txt
  1:33-1:37  warning  Be careful with “butt”, it’s profane in some cases  butt  retext-profanities

⚠ 1 warning
```

## API

### `retext().use(profanities[, options])`

Check for profanities.

###### `options.ignore`
